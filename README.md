# Some data science projects 
## R projects
- To build a model to predict song_genre in Spotify based on appropriate variables in the provided dataset. We compare three models: A linear discriminant analysis, A K-nearest neighbours model with a range of 1 to 100 and 20 levels and A random forest with 100 trees and 5 levels and choose the best one. 
- Analysing the diamonds dataset from the ggplot2 package to predict the price of a diamond using the random forest model. 
## Julia projects 
- Simulating a factory production line that constructs lawnmowers to order.
